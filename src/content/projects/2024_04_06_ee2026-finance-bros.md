Uses the Basys 3 FPGA board.

Implemented a trading simulation with price adjustments and visualisations. There are 4 boards, 1 master board and 3 trader boards

Some features include

- DES Encryption
- VGA Output and OLED Screen Mirroring
- Graphing with Mouse Input & Visualisation

Worked on the

- System Architecture & Python Mockup
- Optimisation of the Menus and Graphing
- UART Communications & Package Format
- Verification and Market Adjustment Algorithms
- Simple Raycasting and Animations
