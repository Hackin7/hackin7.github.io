My new personal goal for my website is to be able to better show off my
skills and projects! Some ideas I have include

1. PhaserJS/ Three.js interactivity
2. Projects/Blog Posts/CTF Challenges/Knowledge Base Listing & Search Feature
3. Interactive CV - Linking to actual projects

I'll probably be working on it on and off, maybe improvements once a week?

This website is built with SvelteKit, Tailwind, and hosted on Github Pages
