An application to assist with ration indents.
Back then, ration indents were not conducive to do on a mobile phone due to UI issues.
This could have led to misindents, as it is hard to visualise all the ration indents at once.
As such, this mobile app aims to improve this through

1. A profile system for ration indents
2. Easy Visualisation of all ration indents of the week through tables
3. Automation of the ration indent forms.

For access to the application source code, please let me know through email or another method.
This is an unofficial app and to be used at your own risk through Expo Go.
