## Inspiration

Ever noticed your fridge is full of expired food that you will never finish? Are you constantly ordering too much food and leaving behind leftovers? Well do I have the app for you! No Waste is an app to help you reduce food waste just by taking a photo of it!

## What it does

Reducing food is as simple as PASSing it through the app!

1. Point at the Food & Take a Photo
2. Analyse the food, whether it is rotten, what type it is, when is it best consumed by.
3. Save any food you are going to keep, and keep track of its expiry date.
4. Share leftovers with others easily

No more digging for information on when something expires! No more forgetting something exists and letting it go to waste!

## How we built it

1. We built the app using React Native and we used Firebase for the real-time database to keep user's data and authentication
2. Our App has AI-based Image recognition based using Tensorflow which we trained using models of rotten food and fresh food pictures
