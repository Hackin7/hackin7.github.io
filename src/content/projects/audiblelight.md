Audible Light is a light for the visually impaired. It allows others to see the visually impaired at night.
As current solutions have no audible feedback, this has audible feedback to make it easier for the blind to use and know if it is on or off. 
This is done with a Digispark, buzzer, switch & LEDs.
A Button light that gives audible feedback for turning on and off. 

Worked on the Electronics and Programming of the device.

Done for Engineering Good's Tech For Good 2019, in the group Solution ZKLT.
