Coffier is a minimalistic coffee timer that focuses on improving the user 
experience through reduced visual clutter so even beginners can make impressive pour-over coffee.

As a companion to James Hoffman's videos on his recipes for various methods
of making coffee including v60 and Aeropress, conveniently embedded within our app, 
we are able to provide minimal instructions to reduce visual clutter.
