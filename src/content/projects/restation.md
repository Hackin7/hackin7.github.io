ReStation acts as a middle-man for people to declutter their homes and list out unused items for others to claim and use.

It involves a Website and a physical locker. 
There is an account system, listing and claiming system and milestone system 
to incentivise the act of recycling your everyday items.

I worked on the physical locker (Raspberry Pi, Arduino system, Kivy UI, TensorFlow Object Recognition System).

Made for the CodeXtremeApps Hackathon, and went to Finals.
