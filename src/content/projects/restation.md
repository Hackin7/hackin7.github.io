ReStation acts as a middle-man for people to declutter their homes and list out unused items for others to claim and use.

The solution features an account system, listing and claiming system and milestone system to incentivise the act of recycling your everyday items.

This project was built in less than 24 hours and I mainly worked on the Raspberry Pi/ Arduino powered locker.
