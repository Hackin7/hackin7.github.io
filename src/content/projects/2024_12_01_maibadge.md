Worked on Concept, Artwork, PCB Component Placement/ Layout, Procurement, Assembly (Soldering). Guided some Juniors through the Electronics/ Embedded Systems Process, and got them to assist with PCB Layout/ make some flashlight PCBs as an. Traded/ Sold some at NUS Makers Market 2024 (Feb) with CircuitBoardArtist, DEFCON 33.
