On 27 and 28th July, NUS Greyhats hosted GreyCTF 2024 Finals. For this event, I've designed a programmable PCB Badge with various functionalities, such as an OLED to display your name, PWM and UART functionality, and various CTF challenges which allow you to unlock different hat colours. Glad to see the participants tinkering around with the hardware, connecting various debug pads, exploiting some vulnerabilities and eventually dumping the firmware of the device!
