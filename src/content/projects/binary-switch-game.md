Inspired by Ben Heck's Hex Game

This is a binary game I made to teach my friends about binary. In the end I play with this in class to keep myself awake.

You convert random denary(0-255) or hexadecimal(0-ff) values on the screen to binary, and then use the 8 main switches to input that binary value. You can choose to convert values to binary forever, or within a 60 second time limit with high scores (Not stored in memory though).

There are also other features, like

1. Spam game, where you spam the button in 60 seconds for high scores
1. A conversion tool, to convert binary to denary, hexadecimal or ASCII
1. An ASCII Text editor, where you enter binary values representing the ASCII character into the screen, and
1. A Main menu, where you enter binary values to access the different features and modes
1. Lack of Sound, so you can play in class( It's a feature, not a bug)
