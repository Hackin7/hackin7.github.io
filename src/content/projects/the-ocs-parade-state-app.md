The OCS Parade State Form is relatively complicated to fill up, needing to
do various calculations for each day of submission. This app improves the
process by

1. Saving the rough manpower state in your phone's local storage, and allowing you to select who is not here and for what reason
2. Calculates various information from this manpower state
3. Automate the parade state form, filling up various fields in a few seconds (if not less)

Used by Charlie Wing & Delta Wing (Maybe other wings but not sure) Store Team.
Maintained by my understudy. (Theres a Github Fork)
