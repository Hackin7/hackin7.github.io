Remote Controlled Robot with HectorSLAM Mapping and Colour Identification.

Unique Features

1. Protoboard
   - Modularity and Reliability
   - <u>The Raspberry Pi can remotely reset and reprogram the Arduino through the UART GPIO Pins</u>
   - 16x2 Onboard LCD for Telemetry
2. Acrylic Casing for Protection
3. Firmware
   - Precise movement using the ATMega2560's Timers & the onboard Ultrasonic Sensor
   - Colour Sensing and Detection
4. Software
   - WASD control
   - HectorSLAM Mapping on a Laptop through ROS Networking
   - <u>Command Line Scripts to easily reset/ reprogram the Arduino during the limited run duration (as well as implement a soft kill)</u>
   - tmux scripts for fast deployment
