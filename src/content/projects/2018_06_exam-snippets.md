An educational quiz made to provide (random) examination questions.
It's meant to help students to self practice whenever and wherever they want to.
You can self-mark papers or for MCQ questions, get the computer to mark for you!

Made in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and VueJs, with a NodeJS and Express backend, and a MongoDB Database.

Since I have finished Secondary School and Junior College I probably won't be updating this website any longer with new features or questions. Feel free to make any pull requests or anything or copy the idea!

Used by my friends and I for studying for 2018 O Levels/ 2020 A Levels
