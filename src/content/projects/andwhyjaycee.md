AndWhyJayCee is a website to help know more about the condition of indigenous languages. This website has 3 main functions

1.  Have awareness that indigenous languages are being endangered and facing extinction
2. Know the indigenous languages in countries (through a world map)
3. Learn or search up (with the help of SUSI AI) some phrases of Ainu by linking them to their English meaning

This is basically a Python Flask web app. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap is used to Style the app. AMCharts 3 is used for the map. Javascript is used to interact with the SUSI API and for some interactivity. Flask is used to host and template the webpage, along with provide some APIs for use with SUSI skills

It is currently not deployed
