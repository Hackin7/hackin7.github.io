This is a program that makes pseudocode Not Pseudocode. It converts Pseudocode meeting the A Level specifications to Python code. You can also run it I guess (with a non-existent standard library).

It is partially based off the standards [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cYJY5ruEcjJh_Ve340oSCuwuAZdZ44e/view?usp=sharing)

The main aim is to be able to convert Pseudocode in A Level Papers (for me I'm from Singapore, so Singapore papers) into working code, and run it to test. However, being Pseudocode, the syntax is inconsistent, so it'll probably never be fully compatible. Nevertheless, for the core syntax, I've tried to make it compatible with the most common forms.
