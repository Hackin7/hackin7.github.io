An educational quiz made to provide (random) examination questions. It's meant to help students to self practice whenever and wherever they want to. You can self-mark papers or for MCQ questions, get the computer to mark for you!

Just a Personal Project to test the MEAN/MEVN stack

Since I have finished Secondary School and Junior College I probably won't be updating this website any longer with new features or questions. Feel free to make any pull requests or anything or copy the idea!
