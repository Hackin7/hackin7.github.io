description: Reintroduction to my website

I'm reimplementing some of my blog again.
My new personal goal for my website is to be able to better show off my
skills and projects! Some ideas I have include

1. PhaserJS/ Three.js interactivity
2. Projects/Blog Posts/CTF Challenges/Knowledge Base Listing & Search Feature
3. Interactive CV - Linking to actual projects

I'll probably be working on it on and off, maybe improvements once a week?

Blogging is messy, and I'm going to restart everything and consolidate it
